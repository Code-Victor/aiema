    title:"How to Perform CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)",
    duration: 3,//minutes
    preamble: `CPR can save a life during a cardiac or breathing emergency. Follow these steps to perform CPR:`,
    content: `Step 1: Check for Responsiveness
- Tap the person and shout their name.  
- If they don’t respond, call for help or tell someone to call emergency services (e.g., 112 in Rwanda).  

Step 2: Check for Breathing  
- Look, listen, and feel for breathing for no more than 10 seconds.  
- If they’re not breathing or only gasping, start CPR immediately.  

Step 3: Start Chest Compressions  
- Place your hands in the center of their chest (one hand on top of the other).  
- Push hard and fast (at least **2 inches deep).  
- Give 100-120 compressions per minute (follow the beat of a song like Stayin’ Alive by the Bee Gees).  

Step 4: Give Rescue Breaths (if trained to do so)
 
- Tilt their head back slightly, pinch their nose shut, and give 2 breaths.  
- Make sure the chest rises with each breath.  
- Continue 30 compressions → 2 breaths until help arrives.  

Step 5: Keep Going Until Help Arrives

Don’t stop unless:  
  ✅ The person starts breathing.  
  ✅ A trained medical professional takes over.  
  ✅ You’re too exhausted to continue.  

If you’re untrained or unsure, stick to hands-only CPR (just chest compressions) until medical help arrives.

    title:"How to Stop Bleeding in an Emergency",
    duration: 5,
    preamble:`If someone is bleeding heavily, act fast to prevent excessive`,
    content:`If someone is bleeding heavily, act fast to prevent excessive blood loss. Follow these steps:  
    
    Step 1: Stay Safe  
    - Wash your hands or wear gloves (if available) to avoid infections.  
    - Ask the person to sit or lie down to prevent dizziness or shock.  
    
    Step 2: Apply Pressure  
    - Use a clean cloth, bandage, or even clothing to press firmly on the wound.  
    - Apply steady pressure for at least 5 minutes without lifting the cloth.  
    
    Step 3: Elevate the Wound (If Possible) 
    - If the bleeding is from an arm or leg, raise it above heart level to slow the blood flow.  
    
    Step 4: Apply a Bandage  
    - Once the bleeding slows, wrap the wound with a clean bandage to keep pressure on it.  
    - Do NOT remove the first layer if blood soaks through—just add more layers on top.  
    
    Step 5: Call for Help If:
      
    🚨 The bleeding doesn’t stop after 10 minutes of pressure.  
    🚨 The wound is deep, large, or caused by a serious injury.  
    🚨 The person feels weak, dizzy, or loses consciousness (signs of shock).  
    🚨 The bleeding is from the head, neck, or abdomen.  
    
    What NOT to Do: 
    Do not remove large objects stuck in the wound (this can make bleeding worse).  
    Do not use a tourniquet unless it's a life-threatening situation and you’re trained to do so.  
    
    Act quickly—stopping bleeding can save a life!`
